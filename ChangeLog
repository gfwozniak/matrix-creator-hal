Bug:

MATRIX HAL compiled and worked on Raspbian Buster, but 
did not work on newer versions of Raspbian or Ubuntu

Fixes: 

1) The original library used a deprecated library called 
WiringPi. The first change was swapping out wiringPi 
for a newer supported library called lgpio.

2) The original library has two methods of sending data 
to the hardware: SPI ioctl calls or with calls to custom
kernel modules. Not wanting to deal with compiling 
against the kernel, I only ported the SPI method.

3) Then the problem with SPI is that the messages sent by 
the library are bigger than the default SPI buffer.
A kernel boot parameter has to be set to make this larger
on startup.
